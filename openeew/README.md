# Contributing to OpenEEW algorithms 

If you want to contribute an algorithm to OpenEEW, please also take into account the following points: 

1. Each method you add or change should contain its own test, based on `unittest` in Python
2. The method should be related to detection, data transmission using MQTT and earthquake characterization
3. If you have some other ideas please [open an issue](https://github.com/openeew/openeew-detection/issues)

Thanks :)
