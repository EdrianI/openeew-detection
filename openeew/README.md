# Contributing to OpenEEW algorithms 

If you want to constribute to OpenEEW with an algorithm you are awesome, please also take into account the following points: 

1. Each method you add or change should contain its own test, based on unittest in python
2. The method should be related to detection, data transmission using mqtt and earthquake characterization
3. If you have some other ideas please contact us 

Thanks :)
